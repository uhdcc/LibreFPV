# LibreFPV
An FPV game that will persevere  
 
Hey, this game is in early prototype development. This is a project that I will work on  
on the weekends. I know the project is ugly right now, but I will be improving the look of  
the game later. For now I'm focusing on gameplay. It only supports Mouse/Keyboard flying and PS5 Controller  
Next thing I'm working on is Radio controller support  



There are 2 ways to get this game.  
1. Build from source. If you build the game yourself, you can do anything  
   like create new tracks, new checkpoints, new quads, etc. Follow the [Quickstart](https://github.com/uhdcc/LibreFPV/blob/main/QuickstartGuide.md) to build the game.  
   
2. You can also just download the "Release" version of the game. This is a Windows executable. The only thing you can do with  
   with the release version is fly around on maps that are included. You can't make maps or do anything else yet,  
   because the project is in early development and i havent made things like a track editor yet. Release versions  
   are shown on the right side of this github page.
