# LibreFPV
 An FPV game that will persevere
 
Hey, this game is in early prototype development. This is a project that I will work on  
on the weekends. I know the project is ugly right now, but I will be improving the look of  
the game later. For now I'm focusing on gameplay. It only supports Mouse/Keyboard flying and PS5 Controller  
Next thing I'm working on is Radio controller support 


There are 2 ways to get this game.
1. Download the .exe from "Releases" on the right side of the page.
3. Build from source

Bulding from source  
There are many ways to build Unreal Engine projects from source. You can google tutorials if  
you don't know how. I use Visual Studio compile, but I think you can use Clang (and maybe others).  
You can even build the engine itself from source. The tutorials are out there.  
It should be as simple as installing Visual Studio and Unreal Engine, and then open the project.

This project uses Visual Studio by defualt, if you want to use a different code editor,  
you will need to enable the plugin associated with it and set your "Source Code Editor"  
in Editor Preferences (shown below).  

Unreal Engine seems to support these code editors, out of the box:  
CLion  
CodeLite  
KDevelop  
Rider  
Visual Studio Code  
Visual Studio  
XCode
