There are many ways to build Unreal Engine projects from source. You can google tutorials if  
you don't know how. I use Visual Studio compile, but I think you can use Clang (and maybe others).  
You can even build the engine itself from source. The tutorials are out there.  
It should be as simple as installing Visual Studio and Unreal Engine, and then open the project.

This project uses Visual Studio by defualt, if you want to use a different code editor,  
you will need to enable the plugin associated with it and set your "Source Code Editor"  
in Editor Preferences (shown below).  

Unreal Engine seems to support these code editors, out of the box:  
CLion  
CodeLite  
KDevelop  
Rider  
Visual Studio Code  
Visual Studio  
XCode
