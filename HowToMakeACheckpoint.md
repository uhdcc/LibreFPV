Click "Checkpoint Jersey Number" on the left side and move it to a spot you like

The jersey number helps track editors to tell what order their checkpoints are in. This won't show in-game, this is only for track editors

Click "Checkpoint Beacon" on the left side and move it to a spot you like

The beacon shows pilots which checkpoint is next when they're flying. I recommend putting this to the side a little,  
	so it doesnt block the pilot's vision when they get close. Meaning, don't put it in the middle of their flight path.
	
Click "Checkpoint Arrow" on the left side and move it to a spot you like

The arrow determines which direction pilots must be flying in order to trigger the checkpoint, but it doesnt show up in-game. it's only for track editors
